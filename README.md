# quizlet-memrise
A simple converter to import flashcards from Quizlet to Memrise, written in Python.

# Instructions
Go to the quizlet page, and copy all of the questions and answers from the page. Make sure that you have no progress in the flashcards, otherwise the headings will break the code. Paste these into `quizlet.txt`.
Then, run convert.py.
Finally, copy the output from memrise.txt into your memrise page using the 'Bulk add' function, hidden in one of the menus.
